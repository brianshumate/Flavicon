Flavicon is a tiny browser extension that warns of Flash object presence in the current page by setting the favicon image to a gnarly scary skull.

Seriously. That's all it does; so if you have some reason to not require a full-fledged Flash/script blocker and also otherwise cannot disable Flash, but you'd still like to quickly spot the source of a new annoying noise from one your 34 open browser tabs, then this might be the extension for you.

* The Chrome version is tested and working, though probably needs more improvements.
* The Firefox version does not yet work.
* The Safari version is not yet under way.

This project is based on the ideas of some cool folks on Twitter (thanks for the inspiration [@ohmybrain](http://tiwtter.com/ohmybrain) and [@juphoff](http://tiwtter.com/juphoff)), was quickly dusted together, and it mostly works; pull requests welcome! :)
